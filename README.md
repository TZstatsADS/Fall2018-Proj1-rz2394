### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Exploratory Data Analysis on Happy Moments
+ This project is conducted by Rui Zhang

+ Project summary: If you ask the people around you to describe the most unforgettable happy moments, you are very likely to be overwhelmed by the variety of their experiences. I'm inspired to explore what might be the potential factors that influence people’s happiness sources. I utilized text mining methods and performed exploratory data analysis to compare the patterns of happiness causes across different subgroups of people. First, I joined the cleaned version of happy moments text file and demographic data. Next, I plot contingency tables of potential factors and the topics of people’s happiness moments and then conducted chi-square tests to check the correlation between them. Then, I used sentiment analysis, topic modelling, bigram, correlation network as well as various plots such as word cloud and global heatmaps to visualize the patterns. In the end, I summarize some interesting results I find.
